# Voxelarium-GCRadixTest

Voxelarium is a procedural world generator I created in 2022 using Unity. It uses a marching cubes algorithm to generate smooth terrain from voxel data. The player is able to explore and sculpt the world similarly to games like Minecraft.
For this test, I’ve implemented dynamic reverb and ambience using a system similar to Bubblespace from Tom Clancy’s The Division 2. I made several adjustments to the system to make it fit better with my game. I’ve used Wwise for audio implementation.
